# CEAC OS Experience V2 — Build State

Last updated: 26 September 2026

## Current programme state

Programme: Experience V2
Status: ACTIVE
Current stage: Stage 3 — Core Component System
Current substage: 3C — Interaction and state primitives (implementation under verification)

Active branch: chatgpt/experience-v2-2026-09-26
Experience V2 baseline SHA: 1a0fb33d3fff18ddae63e6523547b4f4d5d5c883

The branch was created directly from the exact green PR #69 head so that existing fixes and test coverage are retained while the visible product layer is rebuilt safely.

## Protected programme boundaries

PR #69 remains the recovery/reference line from exact green head 1a0fb33d3fff18ddae63e6523547b4f4d5d5c883.

PR #71 remains OPEN DRAFT and FROZEN at bf068f32958134319ea32ecf833748879a163fd2. Do not update, merge, rebuild or discard it while Experience V2 is active.

Stage 13 Payroll remains blocked until CEAC payroll rules are formally confirmed.

## Why Experience V2 exists

Real-device inspection exposed design-quality failures on both phone and laptop that were not caught by the earlier acceptance gate: inconsistent typography, card sizing, layout density, icon treatment, responsive composition and interaction quality.

Repository inspection found the structural causes: a seven-layer CSS cascade, 1,125 !important declarations at the recorded ceiling, a large temporary parity layer, at least two competing hand-built icon systems, no dedicated motion system, no dedicated production icon library, and large screens that mix working data/business logic with presentation.

Safe decision: preserve proven data/security/domain behaviour and progressively rebuild the visible product layer.

## Stage 1 status: COMPLETE

Stage 1 continuity/source-of-truth work is persisted under docs/experience-v2 and in the persistent Library reference package.

## Current engineering checkpoints

Exact verified green foundation checkpoint:
b947f8c88e73eccc46a3a470760b6e546ddbfe5a

Exact verified green documentation/foundation checkpoint:
45fce6eb7e6fec82295d90289e4ef31a1e0699d0
- CI PASS
- Migration Replay PASS
- Account Security PASS
- Complete Quality Gate PASS
- Vercel PASS

A later documentation-only commit recorded that checkpoint. Incoming writers must always inspect actual branch HEAD rather than assuming the SHA above is still current.

Stage 2B dependency checkpoint:
- Installed `lucide-react@1.48.0` and `motion@13.4.4` together through normal npm resolution.
- Changed only `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and this handoff record.
- `npm ci`: PASS (the Work runner used Node 24.19.0 and reported the expected engine warning because the repository requires Node >=22.12 <23).
- `npm run build`: PASS.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high`: PASS, 0 vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- No icon registry, motion provider, gallery or role-screen implementation was started in this checkpoint.
- Screenshots/evidence: not applicable to dependency installation; visual proof remains a later Stage 2 gate.

- [ ] Inspect phone/laptop/desktop proof.
- [ ] Accept Stage 3 and open Stage 4 shell only after 3C passes.

Do not start Stage 4 shell until Stage 3 is accepted.

## Stage 3A implementation checkpoint

Implemented on top of exact accepted Stage 2:
- Button and IconButton families.
- Input, Textarea and Select field families.
- StatusBadge semantic states.
- Surface variants.
- SegmentedControl tab foundation.
- Avatar image/fallback primitive.
- Scoped production component stylesheet under src/experience-v2/components/.
- Static architecture/accessibility tests.
- Protected gallery proof updated to use the production components.
- No role screen migrated.

Stage 3A acceptance: COMPLETE
- Exact accepted SHA: 591d042a77a97681952a513f94c72f97fd70b741.
- CI PASS.
- Migration Replay PASS.
- Account Security PASS.
- Complete Quality Gate PASS.
- Vercel PASS.
- Rendered proof inspected at 390×844, 1366×768 and 1440×900.
- The production controls/surfaces remain visually coherent with the accepted Stage 2 foundation: consistent typography, Lucide icon treatment, control heights, focus geometry, surface restraint and responsive composition.
- Persistent evidence:
  CEAC OS / Experience V2 / Evidence / Stage 3 / 3A / 591d042a77a97681952a513f94c72f97fd70b741
- No role screen was migrated.

## Stage 3B implementation checkpoint

Implemented:
- StatTile with optional drill-in link/action affordance.
- QueueRow and RecordRow.
- ActionFocusCard.
- DataPanel.
- TableShell with semantic table/caption/header markup.
- ProgressDistribution with progressbar semantics.
- Timeline foundation.
- Protected gallery proof using reference-only content.
- Architecture/accessibility/density tests.
- No role screen migrated.

Stage 3B acceptance: COMPLETE
- Exact accepted SHA: c6881aa70c238a883a22dc870c3d210d8f03440c.
- CI PASS.
- Migration Replay PASS.
- Account Security PASS.
- Complete Quality Gate PASS.
- Vercel PASS.
- First Quality Gate attempt failed only because the new boundary test searched for the literal component name "QueueRow"; ManagerHome legitimately uses the older legacy QueueRow from ../components/primitives.
- The test was corrected to detect actual imports from experience-v2/components. No role-screen migration occurred.
- Rendered proof inspected at 390×844, 1366×768 and 1440×900.
- Operational/data primitives remain compact, readable and consistent with the accepted V2 foundation.
- Persistent evidence:
  CEAC OS / Experience V2 / Evidence / Stage 3 / 3B / c6881aa70c238a883a22dc870c3d210d8f03440c

First Stage 3B verification found two issues:
- a test-harness false positive because legacy ManagerHome already contains its own QueueRow symbol; the boundary test now checks V2 imports instead of generic names;
- the Stage 3B gallery split a queue/data panel too narrowly inside the seven-column proof region at laptop width. The proof now stacks operational/data groups inside that constrained region so row text and status geometry remain readable.

## Stage 3C implementation checkpoint

Implemented:
- Tooltip with focus/hover semantics.
- PopoverMenu with outside-click and Escape handling.
- Drawer/Sheet with responsive mobile bottom-sheet treatment.
- ModalDialog and ConfirmDialog.
- Skeleton/Loading treatment.
- Empty/Error/Configuration/Success-capable StatePanel.
- Toast/Confirmation feedback.
- Focus trapping, Escape dismissal and focus restoration for overlays.
- Protected gallery interaction/state proof.
- Playwright keyboard/focus behaviour tests.
- No role screen migrated.

Pending before Stage 3 acceptance:
- rerun exact-head CI/Migration Replay/Account Security/Quality Gate/Vercel with explicit open-state visual evidence;
- inspect base phone/laptop/desktop proof plus phone drawer and laptop modal proof;
- fix any remaining shared interaction/state defect;
- record exact accepted Stage 3 SHA and persistent evidence;
- only then open Stage 4 shell.

Additional visual-acceptance requirement:
- Stage 3C cannot be accepted from closed-state gallery screenshots alone.
- The visual gate now captures the responsive phone drawer and laptop modal while open, in addition to the existing base/motion evidence.

Latest full-gate note:
- The first open-state evidence run exposed two unrelated legacy-gate failures after the new V2 tests themselves passed.
- Executive Home rendered .office-meeting-empty at 10.5px, below the already-ratified 12px operational floor. This selector had been missed by the previous targeted floor hardening. It is now added to the existing scoped 12px floor; this is a legacy hardening correction, not a role-screen V2 migration.
- The Staff/Manager real-work-loop test also timed out because its existing legacy “Send for review” button remained disabled. No Stage 3C component participates in that workflow. This will be treated as a possible fixture/test flake unless it reproduces on the rerun.

Stage 3C verification note:
- First Quality Gate run found a real PopoverMenu focus-restoration bug.
- Escape correctly closed the menu, but focus restoration targeted the wrapper span rather than the actual trigger button, so keyboard context was lost.
- The implementation now restores focus to the button inside the trigger wrapper on Escape and item selection.
- This is a component-level fix; no role screen was changed.

## Current handoff

Chat is the active writer for Stage 3C verification. No unpushed Work state is known.

Do not begin Stage 4 until Stage 3C and the whole Stage 3 component system are accepted.

## Handoff rule

At the end of every meaningful substage, update this file. Never depend on an agent remembering where it stopped. The incoming Chat or Work session must inspect GitHub and this file before continuing. One active writer only.
