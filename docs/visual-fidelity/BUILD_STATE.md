### VF0C — Whole-system visual gap map: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Persisted:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/VF0C_WHOLE_SYSTEM_VISUAL_GAP_MAP.md`
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF0C_ACCEPTANCE.md`

Evidence inspected:
- Quality Gate run `36851322487`
- `visual-parity-all-pages` artifact `11155139632` — 57 primary route screenshots
- `laptop-density-inspection` artifact `11155538765`
- `redesign-r7-product-inspection` artifact `11155458929` — phone/intermediate/laptop/desktop matrix

VF0C decision:
- TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED: YES
- VISUALLY / PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE ACCEPTED: YES for the audit deliverable
- current product visual fidelity: MATERIAL DRIFT RECORDED, not yet accepted as final

Primary system-wide drift now locked:
- universal white-card composition;
- equal visual weighting;
- under-used laptop/desktop canvas;
- mobile serial card stacking;
- insufficient role differentiation inside route content;
- insufficient split/table/ledger/timeline use;
- motion/context continuity not yet fully expressed.

### VF1A — Shell / navigation / command layer: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`2c9600c1e0c18365723dcc7b54c84d21bf52eab0`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF1A_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- Quality Gate `36856711925`: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF1A preserved routing, capability, security and mobile navigation contracts while tightening shell hierarchy and laptop density.

### VF1B — Typography / spacing / surface discipline: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`58f0579c1f3c9b396389ba975d6757e13427abf0`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF1B_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- Quality Gate `36860086949`: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF1B established a flatter shared surface grammar and tighter operational row rhythm without changing business or authority semantics.

### VF1C — Responsive and motion primitives: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`628c4ecc636ba129a31d7f49c653d757ee320834`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF1C_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- CI `36862272664`: PASS
- Migration Replay `36862272584`: PASS
- Account Security `36862272642`: PASS
- Quality Gate `36862272686`: PASS
- Level B browser shards 1–4: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF1C locked shared responsive recomposition, mobile table/segmented-control behaviour and the restrained motion/reduced-motion foundation without changing authority or business semantics.

### VF2A — Staff Today: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`6950a7d235d905cef3dd009ca9370f49f5a7ccce`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF2A_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- CI `36867548905`: PASS
- Migration Replay `36867548964`: PASS
- Account Security `36867549030`: PASS
- Quality Gate `36867549142`: PASS
- Level B browser shards 1–4: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF2A made Staff Today mobile-first and action-led: work-session state and next action dominate, while schedule and factual/ministry context are lighter supporting information.

### VF2B — Staff Work: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`019affd137d57d2c17b1d1707bd9c8e6baf3b5f3`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF2B_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- CI `36870143667`: PASS
- Migration Replay `36870143661`: PASS
- Account Security `36870143673`: PASS
- Quality Gate `36870143634`: PASS
- Level B browser shards 1–4: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF2B flattened Staff Work into an operational list, reduced creation/control dominance, removed duplicate project context from rows, and made Work Detail read as a working surface rather than a sequence of generic cards.

## Active: VF2C — Team / Record / Me / mobile navigation

Purpose:
Finish Staff role character across context, evidence and personal-workspace routes without turning Staff into an administrative dashboard.

Required outcomes:
1. Team reads as lightweight people/context: Unit Room, leadership, availability, directory and references;
2. ordinary Team directory sections use flatter grouped rows instead of large card islands;
3. Record remains evidence-first, with statistics visibly subordinate to completed work, feedback and factual history;
4. My Hub becomes a compact personal workspace, not a six-card destination gallery;
5. personal goals, reminders, leave and ordinary profile information remain self-focused and privacy-safe;
6. preserve existing Staff bottom-navigation reachability, safe-area behaviour and More access without route/authority changes;
7. keep truthful empty states and avoid scores, ranking or inferred productivity;
8. preserve 320–430 responsive acceptance widths and existing People/Personal business contracts;
9. pass targeted Level A during implementation, then exact-head Level B + Level C before family exit.

Do not begin VF3A until VF2C is accepted.

## Protected boundaries

Do not rewrite accepted V2 business logic merely to improve appearance.

Preserve:
- authentication/session contracts;
- RLS/RPC/capability authority;
- organisation isolation;
- privacy and protected HR;
- auditability;
- work semantics;
- finance semantics and currency separation;
- reporting semantics;
- integration security;
- factual/no-inference requirements;
- truthful empty/unconfigured states;
- accessibility and reduced-motion support.

Payroll remains blocked until CEAC payroll rules are formally confirmed.

## Writer handoff rule

At each accepted substage record:
- application SHA;
- Level A result;
- Level B result;
- Level C result;
- evidence path;
- current visual target;
- unresolved drift/blocker;
- exact next substage.

No important state may live only in Chat.
