## Completed

### VF0A — Repository reference lock: COMPLETE

Persisted in GitHub:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/VISUAL_FIDELITY_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/visual-fidelity/REFERENCE_MANIFEST.md`
- `docs/visual-fidelity/references/CEAC_original_premium_mockup_reference.jpg`
- `docs/visual-fidelity/targets/CEAC_PREMIUM_COMPOSITION_TARGET.html`
- root/legacy writer entrypoint bindings.

### VF0B — Acceptance hardening: COMPLETE

Bootstrap PR:
- PR #77
- accepted application head: `4a457173940307bb93e98ca8b59b780d129755ef`
- CI: PASS
- Migration Replay: PASS
- Account Security: PASS
- Quality Gate: PASS
- Vercel: PASS
- protected-main signed squash merge: `76843f94897ece6e62e1cc255bb9da24eef6a15b`

### VF0C — Whole-system visual gap map: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Persisted:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/VF0C_WHOLE_SYSTEM_VISUAL_GAP_MAP.md`
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF0C_ACCEPTANCE.md`

Evidence inspected:
- Quality Gate run `36851322487`
- `visual-parity-all-pages` artifact `11155139632` — 57 primary route screenshots
- `laptop-density-inspection` artifact `11155538765`
- `redesign-r7-product-inspection` artifact `11155458929` — phone/intermediate/laptop/desktop matrix

VF0C decision:
- TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED: YES
- VISUALLY / PRODUCT-EXPERIENCE ACCEPTED: YES for the audit deliverable
- current product visual fidelity: MATERIAL DRIFT RECORDED, not yet accepted as final

Primary system-wide drift now locked:
- universal white-card composition;
- equal visual weighting;
- under-used laptop/desktop canvas;
- mobile serial card stacking;
- insufficient role differentiation inside route content;
- insufficient split/table/ledger/timeline use;
- motion/context continuity not yet fully expressed.

### VF1A — Shell / navigation / command layer: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`2c9600c1e0c18365723dcc7b54c84d21bf52eab0`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF1A_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- Quality Gate `36856711925`: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF1A preserved routing, capability, security and mobile navigation contracts while tightening shell hierarchy and laptop density.

### VF1B — Typography / spacing / surface discipline: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`58f0579c1f3c9b396389ba975d6757e13427abf0`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF1B_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- Quality Gate `36860086949`: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF1B established a flatter shared surface grammar and tighter operational row rhythm without changing business or authority semantics.

### VF1C — Responsive and motion primitives: COMPLETE / ACCEPTED

Exact accepted application head:
`628c4ecc636ba129a31d7f49c653d757ee320834`

Acceptance evidence:
- `docs/visual-fidelity/acceptance/VF1C_ACCEPTANCE.md`
- CI `36862272664`: PASS
- Migration Replay `36862272584`: PASS
- Account Security `36862272642`: PASS
- Quality Gate `36862272686`: PASS
- Level B browser shards 1–4: PASS
- Vercel: PASS

VF1C locked shared responsive recomposition, mobile table/segmented-control behaviour and the restrained motion/reduced-motion foundation without changing authority or business semantics.

## Active: VF2A — Today

Purpose:
Make Staff Today the clearest mobile-first working surface in CEAC OS: one dominant next action, concise work-session state, and lightweight supporting context.

Required outcomes:
1. preserve the existing Staff data, session, work, meeting and announcement contracts;
2. make the first phone viewport answer “what should I do next?” without dashboard noise;
3. keep Needs you, Waiting/Updates and Coming up visually subordinate to the next action;
4. reduce serial card stacking by using flatter grouped rows and section rhythm;
5. keep schedule and factual record useful without competing with immediate work;
6. retain truthful empty states and no synthetic productivity scoring;
7. preserve all 320–430 responsive acceptance widths and safe bottom-nav clearance;
8. pass Level A during implementation, then exact-head Level B + Level C before acceptance.

Do not begin VF2B until VF2A is accepted.

## Protected boundaries

Do not rewrite accepted V2 business logic merely to improve appearance.

Preserve:
- authentication/session contracts;
- RLS/RPC/capability authority;
- organisation isolation;
- privacy and protected HR;
- auditability;
- work semantics;
- finance semantics and currency separation;
- reporting semantics;
- integration security;
- factual/no-inference requirements;
- truthful empty/unconfigured states;
- accessibility and reduced-motion support.

Payroll remains blocked until CEAC payroll rules are formally confirmed.

## Writer handoff rule

At each accepted substage record:
- application SHA;
- Level A result;
- Level B result;
- Level C result;
- evidence path;
- current visual target;
- unresolved drift/blocker;
- exact next substage.

No important state may live only in Chat.
