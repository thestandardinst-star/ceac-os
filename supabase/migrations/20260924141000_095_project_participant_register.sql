-- 095 — Experience Stage 5: reusable project participant/payment register.
-- A camp, conference or family service remains a project. The register is a
-- project capability, not a separate event module.
--
-- Money paid by a participant is append-only here. Remittance between CEAC
-- units remains the existing two-sided internal_transfers contract, now with an
-- optional project/evidence link. Slots can be allocated only when the
-- participant is fully paid. No public portal is introduced; source_kind /
-- source_ref are the import seam for a later external source.
